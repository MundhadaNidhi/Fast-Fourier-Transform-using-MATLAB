# Fast-Fourier-Transform-using-MATLAB
This project describes the simulation of Fast Fourier Transform in MATLAB which shows the time domain and the frequency domain signals for the provided set of frequencies. Herein I am providing three different frequencies, so three different graphs are formed with the colors assigned to them by the user.
